## Requirements

- The quotes are generated randomly one by one.

- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments. Such as the beginning, middle, and end.

- The quotes should be relatively coherent. No exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example.

- Select the number of quotes generated, between 1 and 5.

- Choose between 2 types of quote generators. Accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences.

- Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program.
